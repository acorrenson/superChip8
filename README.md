An emulator for the chip-8 system written in C.

# Installing

SDL2 is required in order to compile the superChip8.

## Usefull commands

Using this program is as simple as typing the command `chip8 file.rom`.
The rom file should be a valid chip8 binary. Some roms are available in the [roms folder](https://github.com/jdrprod/superChip8/tree/master/roms).

The superChip8 can be programmed using chip8 assembly. An assembler for this language is available at [this link](https://github.com/jdrprod/superChip8-compiler).

# Documentation

The specifications of the chip8 system and its language are presented on this [wonderful website](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM).
